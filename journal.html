<p style="font-family:kanit">March 16: Started working on my codesketch. I'm trying to make it so that you are able to shoot the basketball into a hoop but I'm not sure how to be able to drag an object</p>

<p style="font-family:kanit">April 6: I started to work on a birthday card for Phoebe. I learned how to make animations. It is of two horses running and two wolves running. I am trying to make it so that balloons float up but I am not completelely sure on how to do that. I think they will like it either way but as a backup gift I got a beanie because they will definitely like that. It is very their style. </p>


<p style="font-family:kanit">April 14: Yesterday I worked on a randomizer which tells you which dog you will own in the future. I still have to do some writing for it so it's not just a randomizer for a bunch of dogs. The dogs are very cute though so it's ok. I am still working on the basketball game but I need to figure out how to make the animations so it looks realistic and so it looks like it goes through the hoop. I also want to work on design for my website because right now its very clunky and not very pretty.</p>
