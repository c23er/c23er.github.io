<p style="font-family:kanit">March 16: Started working on my codesketch. I'm trying to make it so that you are able to shoot the basketball into a hoop but I'm not sure how to be able to drag an object</p>

<p style="font-family:kanit">April 6: I started to work on a birthday card for Phoebe. I learned how to make animations. It is of two horses running and two wolves running. I am trying to make it so that balloons float up but I am not completelely sure on how to do that. I think they will like it either way but as a backup gift I got a beanie because they will definitely like that. It is very their style. </p>


<p style="font-family:kanit">April 14: Yesterday I worked on a randomizer which tells you which dog you will own in the future. I still have to do some writing for it so it's not just a randomizer for a bunch of dogs. The dogs are very cute though so it's ok. I am still working on the basketball game but I need to figure out how to make the animations so it looks realistic and so it looks like it goes through the hoop. I also want to work on design for my website because right now its very clunky and not very pretty.</p> 

<p style="font-family:kanit">April 25: I have recently been working on a project where I have all my favorite albums on a website. I want it to be so when you click on one of the divs it plays a randomly generated song from that album. I'm still working on it and trying to make it so it will activate a sound when it is clicked.</p> 

<p style="font-family:kanit">May 7: I have been working on my favorite albums thing and I want to make it so right now I have it where you click once, it plays, you click again it pauses, and then I want to make it where when you click the third time it plays a new song from that album. Also I forgot how to do divs so when I want to put an image of the captain america shield that I made in the middle of my homepage, I forgot how to do that. I think that's bad but whatever. I want to keep working on my basketball game, right now nothing works on it. </p> 

<p style="font-family:kanit">May 18: I finished my project with the albums where you click on it and it plays a random song from that album. I haven't completely finished though because I did not add the songs from The Jimi Hendrix album yet so I need to download those songs so I can add those. But I'm basically done so I don't know what to work on now. Sadge </p>

<p style="font-family:kanit">May 25: So the year is basically over, I don't really feel like I completed much this year. I don't really know, I spent so much time on my codesketch with the albums that I don't feel like I really did anything else. Don't get me wrong, I love that codesketch I spent a lot of time on it, I just feel like its underwhelming. Whatever. I remember at the start of the year I was working on a codesketch where I was going to have a basketball game where you click a button and it shoots a ball into a hoop, and it would play a random animation, but then I just stopped. I never actually completed it. I just feel like I could have done more this year. Maybe it was because we only had compsci for two trimesters and it was only once a week so we had less time to work on our codesketches that I feel I could have done more. Anyways, from what I did complete this year I feel like I accomplished a lot. I worked really hard on my album codesketch and I feel like that turned out really well. Additionally, I really like my codesketch with the dogs because they are really cute :). I feel like I could have spent more time on my codesketches and maybe expanded on some codesketches that aren't really finished or feel incomplete. For example, the codesketch where you click on the screen and it spawns a bird could be expanded on and maybe have a game that's included in it. I also would have liked to do a codesketch on football, basketball or marvel, but either way it's fine. I am happy though that I got to implement the things that I created in New Media on to my website because I feel as though those are really cool. I do feel like I accomplished a lot this year and I want to do more coding next year.</p>
